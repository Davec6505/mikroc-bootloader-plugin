## 💡 Learning Tips for Video Tutorials

### Best Practices
1. **Watch at 1.25x-1.5x speed** - Most tutorials work well at faster speeds
2. **Code along** - Pause and type the code yourself, don't just watch
3. **Take notes** - Write down key API names and patterns
4. **Rebuild from scratch** - After finishing, rebuild without watching
5. **Experiment** - Change things and see what breaks

### Active Learning Strategy
```
Watch (15 min) → Code Along (30 min) → Rebuild (45 min) → Experiment (30 min)
```

### When You Get Stuck
1. Check video comments - others often had same issue
2. Pause and search error message
3. Revisit that timestamp later
4. Ask in VS Code Discord/Stack Overflow
